# Reddit Flair Detector

This project currently predicts a flair of a post with Command Line Interface. 

The data analysis reveals that posts with the most number of engagements which is defined as the average of the ratios of comments and likes is highest for sport for this subreddit. This could be attributed to Indians because most Indians are grossly engaged in one or other kind of sports.

Politics is another area which is hotly debated when considering a post on this subreddit. This could be because politics is one key area where everyone excpresses themselves.

Statistics although reveal another interesting story that is Food as a flair has more number of comments as compared to other topics. This could be because Food as a topic evokes an opinion out of people that is fairly divided into a good or bad review.

Further Improvements possible in this project,

1. Web based Interface
2. Accuracy of the model
3. Politics analysis could be carried out by using a bot and making a submission. An analysis of the comments being posted could actually benefit the political parties to gather perception about a policy if it were to materialize.
